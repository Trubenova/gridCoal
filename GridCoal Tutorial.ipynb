    "## Input files and parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "GridCoal requires following inputs: \n",
    "\n",
    "### Demographic history input files [compulsory]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The demographic history of the collection of subpopulations distributed on a grid is represented by matrix of size $T \\times n$ (T rows of n numbers),  $T$ being the number of time points one wishes to define the population sizes at, and $n$ being the number of grid cells. The matrix contains the population sizes of the grid cells at given time points. Each row is the flattened two dimensional grid, indexed from $0$ to $n-1$, defining the sizes of the subpopulations. The first line shall be the oldest time point. In msprime, a population is not allowed to be $0$. In our case, however, we do not want to exclude the possibility that populations can go extinct and get recolonized, even repeatedly, therefore we define $0$ populations to have a technically $0$ size, $10^{-10}$.\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "InputData.txt:\n",
    "\n",

    "### Row number [compulsory]\n",
    "This number together with the demographic history file defines the shape of the spatial map. Must be integer, and the size of the grid (number of all cells - row length of the demographic history input file) must be divisible by the row number. \n",

    "<code>-row 5 </code>\n",
    "or <code>--row_number 5 </code>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Migration list [optional]\n",
    "A migration list indicating migration rate between two connected cells is used to build a migration matrix, and to calculate backward migration during the simulation. \n",
    "Even if two cells are connected by an edge, if the migration is not specified in the list, it is considered 0. \n",
    "Format as lines of triples: Source cell $i$ (integer), target cell $j$ (integer), migration rate $m_{ij}$ (positive float between 0 and 1). \n",
    "Note that if migration exchange migrants both ways, both directions need to be specified. \n",
    "\n",
    "If not the file, but a single number m (float) is specified, migration matrix is generated, assuming that migration is occuring between adjacent cells symetrically with rate m. \n",

    "### List of sampled demes   [optional]\n",
    "A  list of demes (indexes, starting at 0) from which the samples are taken is required. \n",
    " These cells must not be empty at the final time point (presence), but could be empty in the past. \n",
    "Two samples are taken from each indicated deme. \n",

    "### Time periods and generation times [optional]\n",
    "\n",
    "Time between two time steps, denoteddt, is799given in arbitrary time units ( year, months, days, minutes).800Time is measured in generations inmsprime, therefore we need to specify the generation time801of the population at hand. We dene the generation time as the time at which the species comes802to a reproductive age in same units, as dt. Timing of demographic events (into the same units) is803re-calculated by dividing the time of events specied in demography input les by the generation804time of the simulated organism in same units. Therefore, it is possible run the simulations for any805organism with arbitrary generation time, from bacterial populations to trees. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Replicate numer \n",
    "Replicate number can be suplied to specifying the simulation run and the output file. Default value is 1. If value is 1, log file with all input files and their values is created. \n",
    "\n",
    "Enter as: <br>\n",
    "<code>--replicate 7</code> or <code>-rep 7</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ancestral populations\n",
    "At the time point, beyond which the demography is unknown, all lineages are merged into  spatially non-explicit ancestral populations where they follow the standard coalescent process. We assume either a single, or multiple panmictic ancestral populations with specified sizes and a very low rate of migration between them ($10^{-8}$). Furthermore, it is necessary to specify which of the cells originate in which ancestral population.\n",
    "\n",
    "A list determining the origin of each cell can be suplied as a txt file with n (number of all cells) lines. If no file is supplied, all cells are expected to originate in a single spatially non-explicit population. \n",
    "A size of the ancestral populations can be set, default is set to 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "HERE IS A PROLEM, I ONLY SPECIFY ONE SIZE, IF MULTIPLE ORIGINS, IT WILL GIVE AN ERROR. MODIFY. \n",

    "Option that allows printing detailed demography debugger file supplied by msprime. Replicate number must be set to 1. This allows to start simultaneus run of many simulations, with only one debugger file (identical for all) created.  \n",
